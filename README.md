Exploring Housing Prices through Time Series Analysis and Finding the Most Accurate Prediction Model




Abstract
Accurate housing price prediction is crucial as it reflects a region's economic well-being and social fabric. Its impact is far-reaching, from government officials to homebuyers. We aim to leverage Python and machine learning to build a predictive model for housing prices in New York City, a dynamic and complex market. Using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, and Statsmodel, we will process and analyze large datasets to uncover insights and patterns that impact housing prices. Through this project, we hope to develop a reliable and accurate model for predicting housing prices in New York City and push the boundaries of data mining and machine learning in the real estate industry. By exploring new techniques and methods, we aim to enhance our predictions' accuracy and practical value, and ultimately benefit all stakeholders in the housing market.
